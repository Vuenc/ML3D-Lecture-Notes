# ML3D-Lecture-Notes
My notes for the ML3D Lecture at TUM by Prof. Angela Dai.

Files for chapters are in [Obsidian markdown}(https://obsidian.md/), and the project is best viewed as Obsidian vault. I also included a markdown file `00 Notes joined.md` with all chapters joined that can be viewed on github (no LaTeX support on GitHub), and a corresponding HTML file `00 Notes joined.html` which includes LaTeX formulas.
